# fluxite

This library is a thin wrapper around [metrics-runtime](https://docs.rs/metrics-runtime/0.13.0/metrics_runtime/index.html) that supports formatting metrics in [InfluxDB](https://www.influxdata.com/) linefeed and [Graphite](https://graphiteapp.org/) plaintext format and exporting them over UDP.
